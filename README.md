### some thoughts

1. charts ranking changes? focus on latest 4 weeks chart, save the ranking (user id included to avoid confusion) in local storage? comparing the difference > database might be a better approach, however, when to update might be a question to solve. currently, this ranking change feature is on but comparing between 4 weeks data and 6 months data.
2. export and import playlists between different streaming services > check other apis, from track to track is there any way to link them up?
3. add a forum or whateva for users to discuss music topics > need database to do so
4. setting up database for user posts, charting cache
5. add data visualization based on charts, to analyze user's listening habbit > how to make it informative/ interesting
